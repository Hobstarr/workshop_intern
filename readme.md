# Welcome to the Workshop
##### - Here we go!

The aim here is to learn a few things about Python, setting up an IDE, and learn a little about Machine Learning and the security of these systems in the process.

It's just a baseline for understanding what level you are at, and to expose you to some of the things that I am doing whilst trying to give you the best start here.

Let's get started! ------
This will take you on a short journey, and hopefully be fun along the way.

To begin - you need to clone this repository.
You will also need python installed - I'd suggest 3.10 as it's the most stable but any compatible version will do.
